# GH-Pages Portfolio

Github Pages allows you to host static sites directly from your GitHub repositories. The required project for this precourse is to turn your GitHub account into a one-stop-shop showcase of your skills, each project you build in class will be added to the portfolio you start now. You should all be prepared to introduce yourselves with your portfolios on the first day of class.

### Examples

Here is [a simple example](https://elewa-student.github.io) of a GitHub portfolio.  Study how this interactive portfolio was built using only GitHub repos and GH-Pages hosting.  We expect your portfolio to be organized the same way.

Here are a few more advanced portfolios from Elium alumni: 
* [radovandelic](https://radovandelic.github.io)
* [gotaslick](https://gotaslick.github.io)
* [theutmost](https://theutmost.github.io)

### Project
Turn your GitHub account into a portfolio like the examples above.  It should:
* Have a main portfolio page hosted at <username>.github.io
* Feature your solutions to all the Basic Frontent Projects from Free Code Camp
* Have a link to both a gh-pages demo, and the source code for each project
